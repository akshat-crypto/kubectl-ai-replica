# MCP Servers - Model Context Protocol Implementation

## Overview

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an emerging standard that enables AI models to interact with external data sources, tools, and services through a standardized interface. This project provides a production-grade CLI tool and server implementations for working with MCP servers.

## What are MCP Servers?

MCP servers act as bridges between AI models and external systems, providing:
- **Data Access**: Connect to databases, APIs, file systems
- **Tool Integration**: Execute commands, run scripts, interact with services
- **Context Enhancement**: Provide real-time information to AI models
- **Security**: Controlled access to sensitive systems and data

## Industry Use Cases

### 1. Kubernetes 1.33 AI Integration
- **Kubernetes 1.33** introduced AI-powered features using MCP servers
- **Kubectl AI**: Natural language interface for Kubernetes operations
- **Resource Management**: AI-assisted resource optimization and troubleshooting
- **Deployment Automation**: Intelligent deployment strategies and rollback decisions

### 2. AWS MCP Server Ecosystem
- **AWS Bedrock Integration**: Connect AI models to AWS services
- **Lambda Functions**: Serverless AI-powered workflows
- **S3 Data Access**: Secure file operations and analysis
- **EC2 Management**: AI-assisted infrastructure management
- **CloudWatch Integration**: Intelligent monitoring and alerting

### 3. Enterprise Applications
- **Data Analytics**: Real-time data processing and insights
- **DevOps Automation**: CI/CD pipeline optimization
- **Security Operations**: Threat detection and response
- **Customer Support**: AI-powered ticket routing and resolution
- **Financial Services**: Risk assessment and fraud detection

## Features

- **Multi-Server Support**: Connect to multiple MCP servers simultaneously
- **Plugin Architecture**: Extensible server implementations
- **Security**: TLS encryption, authentication, and authorization
- **Monitoring**: Metrics, logging, and health checks
- **CLI Interface**: User-friendly command-line tool
- **Configuration Management**: YAML/JSON configuration support

## Quick Start

```bash
# Build the CLI tool
make build

# Run with configuration
./bin/mcp-cli --config configs/config.yaml

# List available servers
./bin/mcp-cli servers list

# Connect to a specific server
./bin/mcp-cli connect --server aws-s3
```
